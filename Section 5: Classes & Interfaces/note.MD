* Singletons - objects of some class that have only one instance (cl-interfaces-10-private-constructors)
** check private constructor folder
** overall: use private constructor  and static method to get existing instance or create a new one
* Interface 
** becides variables can define method too 
** interface != type
*** interface defined only structure
*** type can define unions
* Types can define functions structure easilly 
** Aslo can be done in a hacky way via interfaces (cl-interfaces-14-interface-function-types)
